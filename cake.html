      <b>Cake Trivia:</b>
    </h2>
    <p> <em>Here are some of the craziest facts about <b>cakes</b>...</em>
      <ol class="orderedlist">
        <li>Origin
          <ul>
            <li> <b>Ancient Egyptians</b> are said to have been the first ones to add honey to bread to make it sweet.So, the origin of cake can be linked to them.</li>
            <li> Early cakes in <b>England</b> were also essentially bread: the most obvious differences between a "cake" and "bread" were the round, flat shape of the cakes, and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while cooking, while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>The famous <b>Red Velvet cake </b>although strikingly red in color is made up of chocolate with red color from the food flavoring agents. Interesting!</li>
        <li> According to the <b>Guinness Book of World Records</b>, the tallest cake measured <em>108.27 feet</em> high and was made by Hakasima-Nilasari Culinary School for the event Amazing Christmas.</li>
        <li><b>Cream filled whoopie pies</b> got their names when Amish women made the cakes and put them in their husbands’ lunches. When the husband opened his lunch and saw the surprise, he yelled <em>“Whoopie!”</em>
        </li>
        <li><b>Cake</b>, a bakery in Chester, England, made the world’s most expensive wedding cake, valued at <em>$52.7 million</em>. The cake had eight-tiers and was decorated with more than 4,000 diamonds. It was on display at the National Gay Wedding Show in Liverpool on March 3, 2013.</li>
